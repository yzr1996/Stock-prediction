# S&P500 Index Predictor
- authors: Eric(Zhenrui) Yu, Guanshu Tao, William Xu

A data science collaboration project during the 2020 winter break.

## Introduction
Stock price prediction has always been a hot topic because it is highly related to capital markets and some changes of state systems are associated with capitals especially in capitalism counties. While it is very difficult to predict the stock market because there are so many factors relating to the price and for some factors we are unaware of their values, such as irrational behaviours and psychological factors of humans on the stock prices. How well can machine learning algorithms do with predicting stock prices? Are machine learning techniques useful on these problems? In this project, we would like to start with L1 and L2 regularization with linear regression and then move to LSTM from recurrent neural network and auto arima in time series forecasting to approach stock price prediction. We chose S&P500 to be our example and  we would like to explore whether the historical price plays an important role in future prices. This question will be focused on by the project: given the price history of S&P500 index, what is the price of S&P500 index today?

Our dataset is from Yahoo Finance and was sourced from Pandas Datareader[@pandas-datareader]. The timeline of the analysis is set from January 1, 2012 to December 17, 2020. Each row in the data set represents the daily performance of the S&P500, and each column represents an attribute of S&P500 (e.g., date, daily high, daily low, opening price, close price, volume, adjusted close price).

To answer the predictive question posed above, we plan to build a recurrent neural networks model called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recurrent neural networks are more effective for sequence data, which can be suitable for our time series analysis. Before building the model, we will partition the data into a training and test data set (split 80%:20%) and perform some exploratory data analysis. We will use a minimum and maximum scaler to scale the price index in the dataset between 0 and 1. In the training data set, we will use the past 60-day (approximately 2 months) index price as a window size to train the model. When compiling the model, we will use Adam optimizer with default learning rate and select mean squared error loss as our criterion. Then we will use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict on our validation set, plot data with comparison on prediction data and validation data, and report validation data and predicted prices in a table. In our prediction analysis we will look at root mean squared error to assess prediction performance. 

After validating the model, we plan to use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the stock index one day beyond the dataset range as a starting point. In the future, we plan to use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict a longer time horizon.

Thus far we have performed some data analysis, and the report for that can be found [here](src/analysis.ipynb).
